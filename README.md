# [Color Guessing Game](https://typescript-rgb-guessing.netlify.app/)

## By **Chris Sanchez**

## [Live Demo](https://typescript-rgb-guessing.netlify.app/)

Color Guessing Game is a game about testing your knowledge of RGB color values. It is a complete rebuild of a previous project that was written with just an index.html, stylesheet, and single JavaScript file. The intention of re-building the game was to explore TypeScript with React as well as using localStorage to persist information on the browser Document, both of which I had never explored before this project.
